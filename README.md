The Leather Apron Consortium


In 1727 Ben Franklin established a club for mutual improvement. It was known as the Junto.

Also known as the Leather Apron Club, its purpose was to debate questions of morals, politics, and natural philosophy, and to exchange knowledge of business affairs. The members were drawn from diverse occupations and backgrounds, but they all shared a spirit of inquiry and a desire to improve themselves, their community, and to help others. 

#H1 The Leather Apron Consortium was founded in 2014 with the express purpose of carrying on that same tradition where software development is concerned. To that end, the consortium seeks members that are kind, hard-working, driven, inquisitive, and above all: cogent thinkers. The consortium seeks all available data, and considers as many perspectives as possible when considering an issue.
